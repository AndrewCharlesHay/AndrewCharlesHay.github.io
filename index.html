        <p>
          At Capital One I was able to hone my development and professional
          skills. Right after college I was given the opportunity to join the
          Capital One Developer Academy. A six month program where I learned 
          the fundamentals of web development and javascript.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the developer academy I joined the Technology Development
          Program, a rotational program in which I am able to display the
          knowledge that I have gained. I honed my skills in Cloud development,
          CI/CD, and Typescript. My team worked on Capital One's digital
          assitant name Eno. I gained my AWS Cloud Solutions Architect Associate
          Certification and as well as my AWS Certified Data Analytics Specialty.
        </p>
        <p>
          My current team built and manages a Angular site that displays data on 
          Capital One's AWS and GCP spend. The site has a Python lambda backend which get
          the data from a daily Elatic Map Reduce job.

          Infoverity is the industry's leading provider of Enterprise Data
          Management solutions. During my internship I built an employee 
          data website with JSP for use by the HR department.

          I also created a AWS Cloudformation script to deploy Informatica Master

          Command Alkon is a leader in Cloud based construction software for

        <p>
          I created a ETL tool to load data from the client side to the cloud

          At The Ohio State I majored in Industrial and Systems Engineering with a
          focus in Management Systems and Operations Research. The advanced
          topics of non-linear programming and dynamic optimization were
          fansinating to me!
        </p>
        <p>
          I was also heavily involved in the Big Data Analytics Association
          (BDAA). We were host to a variety of insightful events, including
          hands-on workshops in which industry professionals teach our members
          about the hottest topics in data analytics, and case competitions in
          which members put the skills they have acquired to the test. I handled
          all the financials as the treasurer.
